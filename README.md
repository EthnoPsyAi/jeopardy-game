# Jeopardy! - Web Game Project

## About the Project

This is a beginner-friendly JavaScript project I built to solidify my understanding of asynchronous code, DOM manipulation, and event handling. It's inspired by the classic game show **Jeopardy!**, and uses real questions pulled from an API to create a fun, interactive trivia experience in the browser.

I created this as part of my web development learning journey and wanted it to feel like a complete mini app I could share and improve. It helped me practice fetching data, dynamically updating HTML with JavaScript, and working with events like clicking on a clue, revealing answers, and restarting the game.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** for the page structure
- **CSS** for styling the board and buttons
- **JavaScript (Vanilla JS)** for all game logic
- **Axios** for making API calls to the [rithm-jeopardy](https://rithm-jeopardy.herokuapp.com/) endpoint

## Personal Note

I built this project as part of my Springboard Bootcamp to grow my confidence with real-world JavaScript features. It helped me learn how to:

- Fetch and filter data from an API
- Dynamically build a web interface from scratch
- Create event-based user interactions

More than just a coding exercise, this felt like building something people could actually use.

Thanks for checking it out!
